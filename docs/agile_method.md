# Agile Method

For this project, we will be using the Agile methodology to manage the development process. Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development that focuses on delivering value to the customer quickly and continuously. 

Epics, sprints and user stories are used to break down the project into manageable chunks and to track progress. There were of course many tasks and bugs in each sprint, however despite their importance they are omitted for readability. 

I will focus on the user stories that were completed in each sprint, along with their priority, as it is more relevant to the project's success and helping the reader understand the project's development process.

# Use of Kanban Boards

<img src="assets/media/todoist.png" width="500">

`Todoist` was chosen intentionally as the software of choice for this project, for it's appropriate simplicity and speed of use relative to the relatively small scale of the project. 

The Kanban board was used to track the progress of each sprint, and to ensure that all user stories were completed on time. The board was updated daily to reflect the progress of each user story, and to identify any potential roadblocks or issues that needed to be addressed.

In the near-term future I intend to use `Todoist` for personal projects, and `Slack` for team projects. When the Project reaches a larger scale I will migrate to more time-intensive software such as `Github Projects`.

# Use of MoSCoW Prioritisation

![alt text](assets/media/agilekey.png)

MoSCoW prioritisation was used to categorise each user story based on its importance to the project. This helped to ensure that the most critical user stories were completed first, and that any less important user stories were completed later in the project. This approach helped to ensure that the project remained on track and that the most important features were delivered on time.

The MoSCoW categories used in this project were:

- **Must have:** Critical features that must be completed for the project to be considered a success.
- **Should have:** Important features that should be completed if possible, but are not critical to the project's success.
- **Could have:** Nice-to-have features that could be completed if time allows, but are not essential to the project.
- **Won't have:** Features that are not required for the project and will not be completed.


The MoSCoW categories were color coded on the Kanban board to make it easy to identify the priority of each user story. 

- Red: Must Have
- Yellow: Should Have
- Blue: Could Have
- Grey: Won't Have

|:----|:----|:----|


| User Story completed ✅ | MoSCow |
|:----|:----|

Regarding the first user story, the following issue was encountered:

 - Safari is not loading the messages, and the user is not able to see the messages on the iPhone.

This lead to the need for unifying the repositories to improve the sustainability of the code and fix security issues with Safari that may be arising from having 2 repositories.

- before, there was a repository for the frontend and a repository for the backend. 
- now, there is only one repository for the entire project, with the backend in the root and the frontend in the `frontend/` folder.
