# Automated and Manual Testing outcomes

This Readme chapter introduces the **outcomes** of the Automated and Manual Testing. For instructions of how to carry out the tests refer to the **Usage & Deployment** readme chapter - for readibility it is not covered here.

The testing process generally favoured **TDD (Test Driven Development)** methodologies, where tests were written before the implementation of features. This approach helps ensure that the codebase remains stable and that new features do not break existing functionality. For that reason the Automatic Testing is introduced first. Manual Testing was then conducted after the completion of the app to ensure that all features work as expected from a user's perspective.

# Automated Testing in Frontend with Jest, Cypress and Playwright

The app includes automatic tests for core components and functionality using testing frameworks like Jest.



## Playwright Testing

Playwright was used as the most important tool for end-to-end testing. It allows for testing the app's functionality from a user's perspective, simulating real interactions with the UI.

The tests are divided into 2 sets of tests: `frontend/playwright/screenshot-tests` and `frontend/playwright/validation-tests`. 

- `frontend/playwright/screenshot-tests` captures the UI at different states in mobile , tablet, laptop and desktop views.
- `frontend/playwright/validation-tests` validates the functionality of the app by simulating user interactions and checking for error and success messages that will guide and/or inform the user.

### Playwright Screenshot Tests

The screenshot tests are used to ensure that the app's UI looks as expected across different screen sizes. The tests capture screenshots of the app in different states and compare them to reference images to detect any visual regressions.

They can be summarised as follows:

| User Journey location | Mobile | Tablet | Laptop | Desktop |

### Playwright Validation Tests

The validation tests are used to ensure that the app's functionality works as expected. They simulate user interactions and check for error and success messages that guide and inform the user.


### Success Message alerts

Due to time constraints, success messages only confirm Sign in and Sign up. Additional creenshots also confirm the Messages disappear after a set time (omitted below).

| Success Alerts | Test 1 | Test 2 | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Screenshots | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmcrean/odyssey-api/main/frontend/playwright/screenshots/alerts/success-alerts/mobile-01-signup-success.png"> |  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lmcrean/odyssey-api/main/frontend/playwright/screenshots/alerts/success-alerts/mobile-03-signin-success.png"> | 
| Alert Description | Signup success | Signin success | 

***
Below are all validation alerts, meaning the user has done something that is not allowed by the app. The app will inform the user of the error and guide them to correct it.

## Jest Testing

Jest testing was explored in the frontend to test the core components and functionality of the app. The tests are located in the `frontend/src/pages` directory, with each page having its own test folder `__tests__`.

Here's a summary of the test files and what they cover:


```bash
 PASS  src/pages/messaging/__tests__/MessageDetailSendFormAPI.test.js
 PASS  src/pages/auth/__tests__/SignUpForm.test.js (5.295 s)
 PASS  src/pages/messaging/__tests__/MessageWithImage.test.js (5.58 s)
 PASS  src/pages/messaging/__tests__/Message.test.js (5.51 s)
 PASS  src/pages/messaging/__tests__/MessageDetailSendForm.test.js (5.992 s)
 PASS  src/App.test.js (6.04 s)

Test Suites: 6 passed, 6 total
Tests:       10 passed, 10 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        7.916 s
Ran all test suites.
```


| Test File | Alert Description | Key Methodologies |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Message.test.js | - Tests fetching and displaying the sender's username<br>- Checks error handling when fetching username fails<br>- Verifies the opening and closing of the delete modal<br>- Ensures proper rendering of message content and metadata | - Mocking API responses (axios)<br>- Rendering components with React Testing Library<br>- Simulating user interactions (fireEvent)<br>- Asynchronous testing (act, waitFor)<br>- Snapshot testing for UI consistency |
| MessageDetailSendForm.test.js | - Tests the submission of a message with an image<br>- Verifies form data handling and API call formation | - Mocking API calls (axiosReq)<br>- Form submission testing<br>- File input handling<br>- Asynchronous testing (waitFor)<br>- Checking API call parameters |
| MessageDetailSendFormAPI.test.js | - Mocks and tests the API call for sending a message with an image<br>- Verifies the structure and content of the API response | - Mocking Axios for API calls<br>- Testing API endpoint and payload<br>- Verifying response structure<br>- Handling FormData in tests |
| MessageWithImage.test.js | - Tests the rendering of a message component with an attached image<br>- Verifies the correct display of message content and image | - Rendering components with React Testing Library<br>- Mocking Context API (useCurrentUser)<br>- Asynchronous component testing (act)<br>- Testing image rendering and attributes |
| SignUpForm.test.js | - Tests the rendering of the sign-up form<br>- Checks form validation and error display<br>- Verifies form submission and redirection on success | - Rendering components with React Testing Library<br>- Mocking API calls (axios)<br>- Simulating form input and submission<br>- Testing error handling and display<br>- Checking navigation/redirection (useHistory mock) |

The most common methodologies used in testing were mocking API calls with `axios` and `jest.mock`, rendering components with `React Testing Library`, simulating user interactions with `fireEvent`, and handling asynchronous testing with `act` and `waitFor`. Asynchronous testing means that the test waits for a certain condition to be met before proceeding, ensuring that the app behaves as expected in real-world scenarios.
