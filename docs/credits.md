## Code Institute Moments app as boilerplate

"Moments" was used as a boilerplate for the project as it contained the necessary features for a social media platform. Both the API and the React frontend were built from this code.
  - Frontend: https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/moments
  - API:  https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/drf-api

## Code institute Repo unification tutorial

A key issue with the project was authnetication not working on Safari browsers, due to having seperate repositories with the frontend and API. 

- [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) provided a tutorial on how to unify the repositories, which was used to fix the issue.

## Use of LLMs

LLMs were used as an AI tool to generate initial drafts which would be meticulously reviewed.

- writing detailed commit messages
- implementation of new features in Javascript, CSS or Python
- drafting readme documentation
- it could be assumed that any file or commit message might have started as an LLM draft which was extensively tested and reviewed.

The limits of LLMs tended to be that they could not generate test-proof code.

The following tools were used to generate such drafts:

- [Claude Sonnet 3.5](http://www.claude.ai/), eventually replacing the use of [GPT-4o](http://www.chatgpt.com/) with it's higher context window of 200,000 tokens.
- [Github Copilot](http://www.github.com/copilot) for inline editing suggestions.
